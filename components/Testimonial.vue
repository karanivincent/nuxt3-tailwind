                            The concept of synergy is a common one, to an extant that it may be deemed as
                            cliche. However, this principle has proven to be a working tool for usas a company.
                            As Synergy Power Systems Ltd, we believe in the combined effort/ working together
                            of two or more parts of a system so that the combined effect isgreater than the sum
                            of the efforts of the parts. Having thisas our base, we have, over the years, formed a
                            working network with our customers and suppliers that has build a support structure
                            for mutual bene t and quality output. Thisapproach has enabled us to incorporate
                            our suppliers and manufacturers in our corporate strategic foresight which has intern
                            allowed us to create a customer centered approach in our operations. Our
                            operations are therefore streamlined in such a way that guarantees working with
                            Synergy Power Systems Limited is a guaranteed solution and assured quality.
